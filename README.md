Problem Statement
Elon Musk has started his own laptop company (Tesla Laptop) in India. He wants to give tough fights to big companies like Apple, Alienware, HP etc.

He does not know how to estimate the price of laptops his company creates. In this competitive laptop market you cannot simply assume things. 
Musk wants to find out some relation between features of a Laptop(eg:- RAM, OS,  etc) and its selling price. But he is not so good at Data Mining. 😥
To solve this problem he already asked his Data Engineering team (from Twitter 🐥🤭) to collect laptop data from various competitors.

Now he needs your (i.e Data Scientist’s) help to solve the following problem. 🥰
